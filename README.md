SnakeGame with High Score and more

Version : 1.4
Date 21-04-2021

**Movement & Level :**
The game is grid based and handled by gameHandler. It consists 3 scenes (menu,main and loading) Since the game is played on a grid I have stored the position (x && y)
for its movement accross on event tick. 

**Scoring and Saving System :**
Used unity's default library since there was not much to be managed. 

**Main Menu with subMenu and How to Play :**
Used standard hide unhide and containers to integrate this.
